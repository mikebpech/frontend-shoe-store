# Aldo Shoe Store

How to start:
1. Run backend server
2. Clone this directory & npm i
3. npm run start in the root

My aldo shoe store will show you different stock changes in real time along with notifications for low-stock or no stock. This also includes recent logs on the side and uses custom hooks to handle notifications.

Sorry for delay; I'm quite busy this week so I couldn't go as far as I would of wanted with it, I sent along another fun project I did last week in the email you can check out. :)
